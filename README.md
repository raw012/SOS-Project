# SOS Project
This project aims to improve the efficiencies in saving the lives of heart attack patients 
by instructing bystander helpers in implementing the CPR(Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) by
CPR instruction videos. In addition, since AED(Automated External Defibrillator）machines
are more powerful than CPR, it is helpful for the another helper to get the AED machines 
using the AED maps.

Key Functions:
1. CPR video
2. AED google maps (outdoor navigator)
3. AED indoor maps (indoor navigator) [Potential functions]

WHY WE NEED THIS?
1) Heart Attack will lead to death within 6 minutes
   -> so immediate and effective rescuing pratices are necessary
2) More than 50% people in the world DO NOT know how to do CPR
   -> so CPR instruction video is the most effective way for people to follow and implement CPR correctly
3) There is no navigator for AED machines specifically for the emergency
   -> so AED maps are useful in filling the market discrepancy
4) To Save More PEOPLE's Lives

FUTURE IMPROVEMENT:
1. Cooperate with Mobile Phone companies in combining SOS functions and these designed functions
2. Using WIFI to capture the signal of SOS emergencies and sending signals to people nearby to help
